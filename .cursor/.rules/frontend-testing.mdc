# Frontend Testing Guidelines

## Test Structure and Organization

- Place tests in `client/tests/` directory. Follow code file path structure.
  Example:
  Code file: client/src/store/store.ts
  Test file: client/tests/store/store.spec.ts
- Use clear and descriptive test names. Group relevant tests with `describe` blocks.
- Isolate test data between `describe` blocks.
- Focus on testing actual business logic. Avoid testing implementation details.
