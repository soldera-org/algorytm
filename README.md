# Algorütm - AI Development Prompts & Cursor Rules

A collection of production-tested AI prompts and Cursor rules, shared as part of the **Prompt of the Week** program.

## 📖 About

This repository accompanies the [Algorütm podcast episode on AI in Development](https://algorytm.captivate.fm/episode/25-09-algorutm-praktilisi-vtteid-ai-rakendamisest-arenduses), where [Soldera](https://soldera.io) shared practical approaches to using AI in software development after nearly 2 years of hands-on experience.

Following listener requests, we're releasing our internal prompts and Cursor rules **one per week** to help the Estonian tech community leverage AI more effectively in their development workflows.

## 🎯 What's Inside

### Current Prompts

#### **Python Backend Development Rules** (`python-backend.mdc`)

_Contribution by Soldera_

Comprehensive Flask/SQLAlchemy 2.0 guidelines with component-based architecture, Pydantic validation, RESTful API patterns, and service layer design. Includes migration strategies from legacy structures and testing best practices.

## 🚀 How to Use

### For Cursor Users

1. **Copy the rule file** to your project's `.cursor/rules/` directory
2. **Configure the glob pattern** in the frontmatter (e.g., `globs: **/*.py`)
3. **Set `alwaysApply`** to `true` (for global rules) or `false` (for file-specific rules)
4. Cursor will automatically apply these rules when working on matching files

### General Use

These prompts can be adapted for:

- Other AI coding assistants (GitHub Copilot, Claude, etc.)
- Team coding guidelines documentation
- Code review checklists
- Onboarding materials
